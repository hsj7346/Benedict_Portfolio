## Welcome to Benedict's Portfolio

### [NBA TOPSHOT NFT ANALYTICS Project](https://github.com/hsj7346/topshot_nft/blob/main/topshot_analysis.ipynb)

This is an on-going project that I have going for myself right now. I've been following the crypto and nft markets since the beginning of 2021. In this project, I am hoping to delve in deeper to the NBA Top Shot market and create a platform that does comprehensive analytics. There are already amazing platforms out there such as MomentRanks and OTMNFT. Similarly, I am hoping to leverage all of the data that is publicly available regarding NBA Top Shot but I want to provide a deeper level of analytics such as buying/selling patterns of the top 50 accounts, under-priced moments detecting algorithms and many others. So far, I've set up an EC2 instance that is automated to collect and scrape as much useful data as possible. 


### [Bitcoin Prediction Project](https://github.com/hsj7346/bitcoin_predictions/blob/master/bitcoin_predictions.ipynb)

With the recent popularity of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens, I wanted to make a prediction algorithm for bitcoin using Reucrrent Neural Networks and make a trading bot that trades with the prediction outcomes. I ended up using two different recurrent neural network models that perorm well with time-series data called the Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit Model (GRU). After training and testing the model, the trading bot trades with a 21.25% profit.

### [Deriving Different Machine Learning Algorithms using NumPy](https://github.com/hsj7346/mlwithnumpy)

In this project, I use NumPy to recreate some of the commonly used machine learning algorithms used today.
The algorithms that I explore include:
- KNN using Euclidean/ Manhattan Distances
- Decision Trees using ID3 Algorithm (information gain with entropy/ prior probabilities)
- Linear and Polynomial Regression using Perceptron Algorithm
- Gradient Descent with different loss functions (Sqaured Loss, HingeLoss) and L1/L2 Regularizers
- Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models
- Deep Learning Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning with multi-armed-bandit problem and QLearning

### [Data Visualization with R ggplot](https://github.com/hsj7346/dataviswithR)

[Link to App](https://benedictjung.shinyapps.io/FinalProj/)

The data I used for my final project is the 2020, 2019,2018,2017 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey data set that is available on Kaggleâ€™s website.
In this project, I use R's ggplot to make data visualizations.

I chose this data set for my project because as a student learning/ pursuing data science, I wanted to explore the industry and learn more about the different drivers and trends in the industry today. It would be interesting to find out more about the current demographics (e.g. age, gender, education level, income level) of people pursuing data science, different tools utilized in the field today (e.g. programming languages) and the level of income by experience. There was a lot of topics I could cover in the data set, but I chose to focus on diversity and trends in the industry. Since Kaggle has data sets from 2017, I tried to visualize changes that has happened over the years.

### [Recreating Doodle Jump using C++](https://github.com/hsj7346/doodlejump)

As the title of the project suggests, I recreate Doodle Jump using C++.
