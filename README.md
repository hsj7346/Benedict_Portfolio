## Welcome to Benedict's Portfolio


### [Bitcoin Prediction Project](https://github.com/hsj7346/bitcoin_predictions/blob/master/bitcoin_predictions.ipynb)

With the recent popularity of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens, I wanted to make a prediction algorithm for bitcoin using Reucrrent Neural Networks and make a trading bot that trades with the prediction outcomes. I ended up using two different recurrent neural network models Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit Model (GRU). After training and testing the model, the trading bot trades with a 21.25% profit.

### [Deriving Different Machine Learning Algorithms using NumPy](https://github.com/hsj7346/mlwithnumpy)

In this project, I use NumPy to recreate some of the commonly used machine learning algorithms used today.
The algorithms that I explore include:
- KNN using Euclidean/ Manhattan Distances
- Decision Trees using ID3 Algorithm (information gain with entropy/ prior probabilities)
- Linear and Polynomial Regression using Perceptron Algorithm
- Gradient Descent with different loss functions (Sqaured Loss, HingeLoss) and L1/L2 Regularizers
- Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models
- Deep Learning Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning with multi-armed-bandit problem and QLearning

### [Recreating Doodle Jump using C++](https://github.com/hsj7346/doodlejump)

As the title of the project suggests, I recreate Doodle Jump using C++.
