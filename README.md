## Welcome to Benedict's Portfolio


### [Bitcoin Prediction Project](https://github.com/hsj7346/bitcoin_predictions/blob/master/bitcoin_predictions.ipynb)

With the recent popularity of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens, I wanted to make a prediction algorithm for bitcoin using Reucrrent Neural Networks and make a trading bot that trades with the prediction outcomes. I ended up using two different recurrent neural network models that perorm well with time-series data called the Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit Model (GRU). After training and testing the model, the trading bot trades with a 21.25% profit.

### [Deriving Different Machine Learning Algorithms using NumPy](https://github.com/hsj7346/mlwithnumpy)

In this project, I use NumPy to recreate some of the commonly used machine learning algorithms used today.
The algorithms that I explore include:
- KNN using Euclidean/ Manhattan Distances
- Decision Trees using ID3 Algorithm (information gain with entropy/ prior probabilities)
- Linear and Polynomial Regression using Perceptron Algorithm
- Gradient Descent with different loss functions (Sqaured Loss, HingeLoss) and L1/L2 Regularizers
- Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models
- Deep Learning Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning with multi-armed-bandit problem and QLearning

### [Recreating Doodle Jump using C++](https://github.com/hsj7346/doodlejump)

As the title of the project suggests, I recreate Doodle Jump using C++.
